# SDK Flows

Ready to get started with SortedPRO? This guide explains some common use cases for PRO's APIs, helping you to see what PRO can do for your business. 

We will cover:

* [Creating and manifesting a consignment with the Classic flow](/pro-sdk/flows/classic-flow.html)
   
   A simple flow to create a consignment, allocate it to a carrier service using criteria of your choosing, retrieve delivery labels, and confirm the delivery with the carrier. 

* [Offering and using delivery options with the Consumer Options flow](/pro-sdk/flows/consumer-options-flow.html) 

   Used when you want to present delivery options to your customer at point of purchase. PRO creates and allocates consignments based on the options the customer selects.

* [Offering and using pickup options with the Consumer Options Pickup flow](/pro-sdk/flows/consumer-options-pickup-flow.html)

   Similar to the **Consumer Options** flow, but used when offering delivery to a pickup/drop-off (PUDO) location rather than home delivery. 

* [Creating a pack order flow from a PRO order with the Order Flex flow](/pro-sdk/flows/order-flex-flow.html)

   Used when you can't guarantee that all parts of a customer's order will be picked, packed and dispatched from the same place at the same time. PRO can generate multiple consignments from a single customer order where required.

* [Using delivery options to create a pack order flow with the Consumer Options Flex flow](/pro-sdk/flows/consumer-options-flex-flow.html)

   Used when you can't guarantee that all parts of a customer's order will be picked, packed and dispatched from the same place at the same time, and you want to present delivery options to your customer at point of purchase.

* [Obtaining and selecting delivery quotes with the Quotes flow](/pro-sdk/flows/quotes-flow.html)

   Used to obtain a full list of potential delivery services for a consignment. Often used to validate a consignment's detail or to enable a customer service operator to get quotes for a customer manually and act on the customer's response.
